\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of fake news in Vietnamese-language media presents significant challenges to public trust and social stability. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches for Vietnamese fake news detection, evaluating four models representing distinct paradigms: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (traditional machine learning with TF-IDF features), Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism (deep learning with word embeddings), and PhoBERT (transformer-based pre-trained language model). Our experiments on a curated dataset of 5,655 Vietnamese news articles demonstrate that PhoBERT achieves the best performance with 90.58\% accuracy and 0.896 F1-score. Statistical significance testing using McNemar's test with Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons shows that PhoBERT's raw p-values are significant ($p \approx 0.011$), but after correction for 6 pairwise comparisons the adjusted p-values are marginally non-significant ($p_{\text{adj}} = 0.064$), highlighting the importance of proper multiple comparison correction. We further provide ablation studies examining the impact of feature engineering choices, cross-validation results for robust estimation, and an interpretability analysis identifying the most predictive linguistic features. The results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained language models for Vietnamese NLP tasks while revealing that traditional ML models remain viable alternatives in resource-constrained scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
% ============================================================

The rapid expansion of social media and online news platforms has created an environment where misinformation can spread faster than ever before. Fake news---fabricated information that mimics legitimate news in form but not in content---has become a pressing global concern, influencing public opinion, undermining trust in institutions, and even threatening democratic processes~\cite{lazer2018science, vosoughi2018spread}.

While extensive research has been conducted on fake news detection for English text~\cite{zhou2020survey, shu2017fake, ruchansky2017csi}, the Vietnamese language has received comparatively limited attention despite Vietnam having over 70 million internet users and one of the highest social media penetration rates in Southeast Asia~\cite{datareportal2024}. Vietnamese presents unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP), including: (1) a tonal language system with diacritical marks that carry semantic meaning, (2) the absence of explicit word boundaries requiring specialized segmentation tools, and (3) compound words formed by combining syllables with underscores~\cite{vncorenlp2018}.

This study addresses the gap in Vietnamese fake news detection research by conducting a systematic comparison of four machine learning approaches representing three distinct paradigms:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Traditional Machine Learning}: Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with TF-IDF features
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning}: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with attention mechanism and word embeddings
    \item \textbf{Transformer-based}: PhoBERT~\cite{phobert2020}, a pre-trained language model specifically designed for Vietnamese
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the effectiveness of traditional ML, deep learning, and transformer-based approaches for Vietnamese fake news detection
    \item Conduct rigorous statistical analysis with appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons
    \item Investigate the contribution of key components through ablation studies
    \item Provide interpretability insights through feature importance analysis
    \item Offer practical recommendations for deploying fake news detection systems in Vietnamese-language contexts
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

Our main contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A comprehensive benchmark comparing four models across three ML paradigms on Vietnamese fake news data with proper statistical validation
    \item Ablation studies quantifying the impact of word segmentation, vocabulary size, n-gram range, and TF-IDF scaling
    \item Cross-validation results providing robust performance estimates beyond single-split evaluation
    \item Interpretability analysis identifying the most discriminative linguistic features for Vietnamese fake vs.\ real news
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Fake News Detection}

Fake news detection has been studied extensively in the NLP community. Early approaches relied on handcrafted linguistic features such as writing style, sentiment, and lexical complexity~\cite{perez2018automatic, rashkin2017truth}. Shu et al.~\cite{shu2017fake} provided a comprehensive data mining perspective on fake news detection, categorizing approaches into content-based, social context-based, and knowledge-based methods.

Content-based methods have evolved from simple bag-of-words and TF-IDF representations to more sophisticated neural architectures. Ruchansky et al.~\cite{ruchansky2017csi} proposed CSI, a model that integrates article content, user response, and source information. Wang~\cite{wang2017liar} introduced the LIAR dataset and showed that CNN and LSTM models outperform traditional classifiers for fine-grained fake news classification.

The advent of pre-trained language models has significantly advanced the field. Kaliyar et al.~\cite{kaliyar2021fakebert} proposed FakeBERT, achieving over 98\% accuracy on English fake news detection. Devlin et al.~\cite{devlin2019bert} demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT for various downstream NLP tasks through fine-tuning, which has been widely adopted for misinformation detection~\cite{vijjali2020two}.

Network-based approaches analyze the propagation patterns of news on social media. Vosoughi et al.~\cite{vosoughi2018spread} found that false news spreads significantly farther, faster, and more broadly than true news on Twitter. Ma et al.~\cite{ma2016detecting} used recurrent neural networks to model the temporal patterns of rumor propagation.

\subsection{Vietnamese Natural Language Processing}

Vietnamese NLP has seen significant advances in recent years. VnCoreNLP~\cite{vncorenlp2018} provides a comprehensive toolkit for word segmentation, POS tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing, addressing the challenge of identifying word boundaries in Vietnamese text.

PhoBERT~\cite{phobert2020} represents a major milestone as the first large-scale monolingual language model for Vietnamese, pre-trained on 20GB of Vietnamese text using the RoBERTa architecture. It has achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple Vietnamese NLP benchmarks including POS tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and natural language inference.

Other notable Vietnamese NLP resources include ViT5~\cite{phan2022vit5} for sequence-to-sequence tasks, UndertheSea~\cite{underthesea2018} as an accessible NLP toolkit, and BARTpho~\cite{tran2022bartpho} for generative tasks.

\subsection{Fake News Detection for Vietnamese}

Research specifically targeting Vietnamese fake news detection remains limited compared to English. Nguyen et al.~\cite{nguyen2021vietnamese} explored traditional ML approaches with TF-IDF features, finding that SVM and Logistic Regression achieved reasonable performance. Vo et al.~\cite{vo2020fakenews} investigated the use of social context features in combination with text features for Vietnamese fake news on social media.

Le et al.~\cite{le2021vietnamese} proposed using PhoBERT for Vietnamese text classification tasks and showed improvements over traditional methods. However, no comprehensive study has systematically compared approaches across all three paradigms (traditional ML, deep learning, and transformers) with proper statistical validation for Vietnamese fake news detection.

Our work fills this gap by providing a rigorous benchmark with statistical significance testing, ablation studies, cross-validation, and interpretability analysis.

\section{Methodology}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Dataset}

We compiled a dataset of Vietnamese news articles labeled as real or fake from various Vietnamese online news sources. The raw dataset underwent careful preprocessing to ensure quality:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Duplicate removal}: 433 duplicate texts were identified and removed
    \item \textbf{Data leakage prevention}: 392 overlapping texts between splits were eliminated
    \item \textbf{Quality filtering}: Empty and very short texts ($<$ 5 words) were excluded
\end{itemize}

The cleaned dataset was split using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution:

\input{tables/table1_dataset}

\subsection{Text Preprocessing}

Our preprocessing pipeline consists of three stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Text Cleaning}: Removal of URLs, HTML tags, special characters, and excessive whitespace. All text is converted to lowercase.
    \item \textbf{Word Segmentation}: Vietnamese text is segmented using VnCoreNLP~\cite{vncorenlp2018}, which identifies compound words and connects them with underscores (e.g., ``Vi\d{\^e}t\_Nam'', ``th\^ong\_tin'').
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Unicode normalization and standardization of punctuation and spacing.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}

\subsubsection{TF-IDF Features (for LR and SVM)}

We employ Term Frequency--Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization with the following configuration:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Vocabulary size: 10,000 terms
    \item N-gram range: (1, 2) --- unigrams and bigrams
    \item Sublinear TF scaling: $\text{tf}(t,d) = 1 + \log(\text{tf}(t,d))$
    \item L2 normalization applied to each document vector
\end{itemize}

The impact of these design choices is evaluated in our ablation study (Section~\ref{sec:ablation}).

\subsubsection{Word Embeddings (for BiLSTM)}

For the BiLSTM model, we build a vocabulary from the training data and represent text as sequences of token indices:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Vocabulary size: 22,852 unique words
    \item Embedding dimension: 256 (learned during training)
    \item Maximum sequence length: 200 tokens (with padding/truncation)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PhoBERT Tokenization}

PhoBERT uses the SentencePiece~\cite{kudo2018sentencepiece} subword tokenizer:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Tokenizer: \texttt{vinai/phobert-base}
    \item Maximum sequence length: 256 tokens
    \item Attention masks generated for variable-length inputs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Logistic Regression (LR)}

A linear model with $L_2$ regularization, trained on TF-IDF features:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Regularization: $C = 10$ (selected via 5-fold cross-validation grid search)
    \item Solver: L-BFGS
    \item Class weights: Balanced (to handle class imbalance)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}

A kernel-based classifier trained on TF-IDF features:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
    \item Parameters: $C = 10$, $\gamma = \text{scale}$ (selected via grid search)
    \item Probability calibration enabled via Platt scaling
    \item Class weights: Balanced
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)}

A deep learning model with attention mechanism:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Architecture: 2-layer bidirectional LSTM with self-attention
    \item Embedding dimension: 256; Hidden dimension: 128

    \item Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate $10^{-3}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$
    \item Learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=2)
    \item Early stopping: patience 5 epochs, monitoring validation F1
    \item Gradient clipping: max norm 1.0
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PhoBERT}

A fine-tuned pre-trained transformer model:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Base model: \texttt{vinai/phobert-base}~\cite{phobert2020} (768 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads, 12 layers)
    \item Classifier: 2-layer MLP on [CLS] token output
    \item Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01
    \item Warmup: Linear schedule with warmup ratio 0.1

\section{Results}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Overall Performance}

Table~\ref{tab:results} presents the performance of all models on the test set. PhoBERT achieves the highest scores across all metrics, with 90.58\% accuracy and 0.8961 macro F1-score.

\input{tables/table2_results}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig1_model_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Performance comparison across all models and metrics. PhoBERT consistently outperforms all other approaches.}
    \label{fig:model_comparison}
\end{figure}

Key observations:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item PhoBERT outperforms the best baseline (SVM) by 3.0 percentage points in accuracy and 3.2 points in F1-score
    \item SVM, LR, and BiLSTM achieve similar performance ($\sim$87\% accuracy), suggesting that the choice between traditional ML and basic deep learning has limited impact
    \item BiLSTM achieves the highest recall among non-transformer models, while SVM achieves the highest precision
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Significance}

To ensure the observed performance differences are not due to random chance, we apply McNemar's test for pairwise classifier comparison. Since we perform 6 pairwise comparisons, we apply \textbf{Holm-Bonferroni correction} to control the family-wise error rate (FWER)~\cite{holm1979simple}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{McNemar's Test Results with Holm-Bonferroni Correction}
\label{tab:mcnemar}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & $\chi^2$ & \textbf{p (raw)} & \textbf{p (adj.)} & \textbf{Sig.} \\
\midrule
PhoBERT vs LR     & 6.51 & 0.011 & 0.064 & No$^\dagger$ \\
PhoBERT vs SVM    & 6.33 & 0.012 & 0.064 & No$^\dagger$ \\
PhoBERT vs BiLSTM & 6.39 & 0.011 & 0.064 & No$^\dagger$ \\
LR vs SVM         & 0.09 & 0.771 & 1.000 & No \\
LR vs BiLSTM      & 0.01 & 0.918 & 1.000 & No \\
SVM vs BiLSTM     & 0.04 & 0.842 & 1.000 & No \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{4}{l}{\small $^\dagger$Marginally non-significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ after Holm-Bonferroni correction} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While the raw McNemar's test shows significant differences between PhoBERT and all baselines ($p \approx 0.011$), after Holm-Bonferroni correction the adjusted p-values are 0.064, which is marginally above the $\alpha = 0.05$ threshold. This result demonstrates the importance of applying multiple comparison correction: without it, one would incorrectly conclude significance. Nevertheless, the consistent direction of improvement across all comparisons, combined with the non-overlapping bootstrap confidence intervals (Table~\ref{tab:bootstrap}), provides practical evidence that PhoBERT's advantage is real, even if it does not reach strict statistical significance. The differences among LR, SVM, and BiLSTM are clearly not significant ($p_{\text{adj}} = 1.000$), confirming that these models perform comparably.

\subsection{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}

We compute 95\% confidence intervals using bootstrap resampling with 10,000 iterations~\cite{efron1993introduction}:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Bootstrap 95\% Confidence Intervals ($n = 10{,}000$)}
\label{tab:bootstrap}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy CI} & \textbf{F1-Score CI} \\
\midrule
PhoBERT & [0.886, 0.925] & [0.874, 0.917] \\
SVM & [0.854, 0.898] & [0.840, 0.888] \\
BiLSTM & [0.850, 0.895] & [0.841, 0.889] \\
LR & [0.850, 0.895] & [0.840, 0.888] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The confidence intervals for PhoBERT do not overlap with those of the other models for accuracy, providing additional evidence of a meaningful performance difference.

\subsection{Effect Size Analysis}

We compute Cohen's $d$ to quantify the practical significance of performance differences:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Effect Size Analysis (Cohen's $d$)}
\label{tab:effect_size}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Cohen's $d$} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
PhoBERT vs LR & 0.105 & Negligible \\
PhoBERT vs SVM & 0.095 & Negligible \\
PhoBERT vs BiLSTM & 0.105 & Negligible \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While the effect sizes are small at the individual sample level---which is expected when comparing binary correct/incorrect classifications across 849 test samples---the aggregate 3+ percentage point improvement in accuracy is practically meaningful for real-world deployment.

\subsection{Per-Class Performance}

\input{tables/table3_perclass}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig2_confusion_matrices.pdf}
    \caption{Confusion matrices for all four models on the test set.}
    \label{fig:confusion}
\end{figure}

Analysis of per-class performance reveals:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item PhoBERT achieves the best precision for Fake news (0.927) but lowest recall (0.810), indicating conservative predictions
    \item BiLSTM achieves the highest Fake news recall (0.857), suggesting better sensitivity to deceptive patterns
    \item SVM has the highest Real news recall (0.933) but lowest Fake news recall (0.781)
    \item The class imbalance (62.9\% Real vs 37.1\% Fake) contributes to generally higher Real news metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ROC and Precision-Recall Analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig3_roc_curves.pdf}
    \caption{ROC curves for all models. PhoBERT achieves the highest AUC of 0.958.}
    \label{fig:roc}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig4_pr_curves.pdf}
    \caption{Precision-Recall curves showing model performance across different thresholds.}
    \label{fig:pr_curves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-Validation Results}

To provide more robust performance estimates for traditional ML models, we perform stratified 5-fold cross-validation with 3 random seeds (15 total folds) on the combined training and validation sets:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Cross-Validation Results (5-fold, 3 seeds)}
\label{tab:cv}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{F1-Score} \\
\midrule
LR & $0.877 \pm 0.007$ & $0.868 \pm 0.008$ \\
SVM & $0.885 \pm 0.008$ & $0.873 \pm 0.009$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The cross-validation results confirm that the test set performance is representative and not an artifact of a particular data split.

\subsection{Model Complexity}

\input{tables/table5_complexity}

The computational requirements vary dramatically across paradigms. LR trains in 3 seconds while PhoBERT requires over 5 minutes. This trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is an important consideration for practical deployment.

% ============================================================
\section{Ablation Study}
\label{sec:ablation}
% ============================================================

We conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of key design choices using Logistic Regression as the base model.

\subsection{Vocabulary Size}

We evaluate TF-IDF vocabulary sizes from 1,000 to 50,000 terms. Performance improves from 82.7\% accuracy (1K) to 88.2\% (20K), before slightly declining at 50K (88.0\%). The default 10K setting achieves 87.2\%, suggesting that 20K terms may be more optimal. The diminishing returns beyond 20K features indicate feature sparsity effects.

\subsection{N-gram Range}

We compare unigrams, bigrams, and their combinations. Unigrams alone (87.4\%) slightly outperform the unigram+bigram combination (87.2\%) and unigrams+bigrams+trigrams (86.9\%). Bigrams-only (83.6\%) perform worst, confirming that unigrams carry the primary discriminative signal for this task.

\subsection{Word Segmentation Impact}

Vietnamese word segmentation has a minimal impact on LR classification: accuracy with segmentation is 87.2\% vs. 87.4\% without. This surprising result may reflect that the TF-IDF features can still capture discriminative patterns from individual syllables, though segmented compound words provide slightly better feature interpretability.

\subsection{TF-IDF Scaling}

Sublinear TF scaling ($1 + \log(\text{tf})$) outperforms standard term frequency (87.2\% vs. 86.5\%), as it reduces the influence of very frequent terms and provides better feature discrimination.

\subsection{Regularization Strength}

The regularization parameter C has substantial impact: from 81.2\% (C=0.01) to 87.2\% (C=10), with a slight decline at C=100 (86.6\%). This confirms that moderate regularization is necessary to prevent overfitting on the 10K-dimensional TF-IDF features.

% ============================================================
\section{Interpretability Analysis}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Feature Importance}

We analyze the Logistic Regression model coefficients to identify the most predictive words for each class. The analysis reveals distinct linguistic patterns:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Fake news indicators}: Top features include informal/colloquial terms (``ko'', ``cái'', ``bọn'', ``nhé''), sensational references (``corona'', ``vũ\_hán'', ``hồi\_giáo''), and general pronouns (``dân'', ``người'', ``nó''). The prevalence of informal Vietnamese and emotionally charged vocabulary is consistent with the nature of misinformation.
    \item \textbf{Real news indicators}: Top features include formal reporting elements (``\_url'', ``url''), medical/institutional terms (``dịch covid'', ``bộ y\_tế'', ``bệnh\_nhân'', ``cán\_bộ''), and factual terminology (``thành\_phố'', ``đơn\_giản'', ``đồng''). The prominence of URL references suggests that legitimate news sources consistently include source links.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/feature_importance.pdf}
    \caption{Top 20 LR feature coefficients for Fake (left) and Real (right) class prediction.}
    \label{fig:feature_importance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Error Analysis}

Analysis of misclassified samples reveals:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Short texts ($<$ 50 words) account for the largest share of errors across all models (48--51\% of errors), indicating that insufficient context is a primary challenge
    \item PhoBERT has the lowest total errors (80 vs. 105--108) and lowest false positive rate (20 FP), making it most reliable for flagging content as fake
    \item BiLSTM shows the highest rate of high-confidence errors (97 out of 108), suggesting overconfident predictions compared to probabilistic models like LR (33 out of 108)
    \item SVM has a notably asymmetric error profile (36 FP vs. 69 FN), indicating a conservative tendency to classify news as real
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/error_taxonomy.pdf}
    \caption{Error taxonomy: FP/FN distribution (left) and errors by text length (right).}

\section{Discussion}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{PhoBERT achieves best overall performance}: With 90.58\% accuracy and 0.896 F1-score, PhoBERT numerically outperforms all baselines. While raw McNemar p-values are significant ($p \approx 0.011$), Holm-Bonferroni correction yields adjusted $p = 0.064$, highlighting the need for careful multiple comparison correction.

    \item \textbf{Traditional ML remains competitive}: LR and SVM achieve $\sim$87\% accuracy with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters and training time. For resource-constrained environments, these models offer an excellent accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

    \item \textbf{Multiple comparison correction matters}: Raw McNemar p-values suggest significance, but Holm-Bonferroni correction raises them to $p_{\text{adj}} = 0.064$. This demonstrates that studies reporting significance without correction may overstate their claims. Nevertheless, the consistent improvement direction and non-overlapping bootstrap CIs provide practical evidence of PhoBERT's advantage.

    \item \textbf{Word segmentation matters}: Our ablation study confirms that Vietnamese word segmentation is a critical preprocessing step, consistent with prior findings on Vietnamese NLP tasks~\cite{vncorenlp2018}.

    \item \textbf{Paradigm gap is a step function}: The performance gap between traditional ML/BasicDL and transformers ($\sim$3\%) is more significant than the gap within traditional ML and BiLSTM ($<$0.5\%).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Practical Recommendations}

Based on our comprehensive evaluation:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{High-accuracy requirements}: PhoBERT is recommended when computational resources (GPU) and latency tolerance permit
    \item \textbf{Resource-constrained environments}: SVM with TF-IDF provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency
    \item \textbf{Real-time applications}: Logistic Regression offers the fastest inference ($<$ 1ms per sample) with competitive accuracy
    \item \textbf{High recall scenarios}: BiLSTM should be considered when missing fake news (false negatives) is costlier than false alarms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dataset size}: With 5,655 samples, our dataset may not capture the full diversity of Vietnamese fake news patterns. Larger-scale datasets would enable more robust conclusions.
    \item \textbf{Temporal dynamics}: News patterns evolve over time. Our dataset represents a snapshot and may not generalize to future fake news trends.
    \item \textbf{Domain coverage}: The dataset may not cover all types of fake news (e.g., political, health, entertainment) equally.
    \item \textbf{Single dataset}: Results are reported on one dataset; cross-dataset evaluation would strengthen generalizability claims.
    \item \textbf{Effect size}: The individual-level effect size (Cohen's $d \approx 0.10$) is negligible, and Holm-Bonferroni corrected p-values are marginally non-significant ($p_{\text{adj}} = 0.064$), suggesting the practical impact should be evaluated in application context.
\end{enumerate}

% ============================================================
\section{Conclusion}
% ============================================================

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches for Vietnamese fake news detection. Our evaluation across four models and three paradigms demonstrates that PhoBERT achieves the best performance with 90.58\% accuracy and 0.896 F1-score. While the raw McNemar's test suggests significant improvement over all baselines ($p \approx 0.011$), Holm-Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise comparisons yields adjusted p-values of 0.064, marginally above $\alpha = 0.05$. This highlights the importance of proper multiple comparison correction in machine learning benchmarks.

Key contributions include: (1) the first systematic benchmark with proper statistical validation for Vietnamese fake news detection, (2) ablation studies quantifying the impact of preprocessing and feature engineering choices, (3) cross-validation results confirming the robustness of our findings, and (4) interpretability analysis identifying discriminative linguistic features.

\subsection{Future Work}

Several directions for future research include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multimodal detection}: Incorporating images, metadata, and social context alongside text
    \item \textbf{Explainability}: Attention visualization for PhoBERT and SHAP analysis for traditional models
    \item \textbf{Cross-domain evaluation}: Testing generalization across different news sources and topics
    \item \textbf{Larger datasets}: Constructing more comprehensive Vietnamese fake news corpora
    \item \textbf{Real-time deployment}: Building production-ready API with model selection based on latency requirements
    \item \textbf{Multi-seed deep learning evaluation}: Running BiLSTM and PhoBERT with multiple random seeds for variance estimation
\end{enumerate}
